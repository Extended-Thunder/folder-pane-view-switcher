                    This add-on adds arrow buttons at the top of the folder pane
                    which rotate back and forth through the various available
                    folder views.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This add-on also causes Thunderbird to automatically switch
                    to the "All Folders" view when you hover over the title bar
                    above the folder tree for several seconds during a message
                    drag & drop operation, and switch back automatically after
                    the drop. In the add-on preferences, you can set the delay
                    before the view is switched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, in the add-on preferences, you can select which
                    views are accessible in the pop-up menu at the top of the
                    folder list, and of those, which show up when you rotate
                    through the views using the arrow buttons.
                </p>
